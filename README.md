This repository consists of a few select projects, etc. that I completed during my graduate studies. I attended DePaul University from January 2017-June 2018, and am hopefully getting my Master's in Predictive Analytics in June 2018.

### Coursework
My favorite class at DePaul was definitely [Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/pages/courseinfo.aspx?CrseId=012552). This repository has two written reports from that course: a case study and a final project. 

* [Ensemble methods case study](https://github.com/adamisch/grad/blob/master/casestudy1.pdf) on how counties voted in the 2016 United States Presidential election  (R)
* [Text classification project](https://github.com/adamisch/grad/blob/master/CSC529Final.html) that predicts subject categories for quizbowl questions (Python, [HTML preview here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/adamisch/grad/blob/master/CSC529Final.html))
