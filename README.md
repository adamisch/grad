I'm Alex Damisch. I currently work for Underwriters Laboratories on the Artificial Intelligence Lab Team.


This repository consists of a few select projects, etc. that I completed during my graduate studies. I attended DePaul University from January 2017-June 2018, and received my Master's in Predictive Analytics with a Concentration in Computational Methods in June 2018.


## Contents
### Coursework
My favorite class at DePaul was definitely [Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/pages/courseinfo.aspx?CrseId=012552). This repository has two written reports from that course: a case study and a final project. 

* [Ensemble methods case study](https://github.com/adamisch/grad/blob/master/casestudy1.pdf) on how counties voted in the 2016 United States Presidential election  (R)
* [Text classification project](https://github.com/adamisch/grad/blob/master/CSC529Final.html) that predicts subject categories for quizbowl questions (Python, [Jupyter notebook here](https://github.com/adamisch/grad/blob/master/CSC529Final.ipynb))

#### To Do:
* Use training/test/evaluation set for parameters in text classification project

### Internships
I interned with the Chicago Transit Authority in January-May 2017 as an Energy Intern, then in January-May 2018 as a Data Solutions Intern.

* [CTA 2018](https://github.com/adamisch/grad/tree/master/CTA%202018) is an offline plotly app. It reads in my own pre-calculated ridership estimates for each station for every half hour over the course of a day, plots them based on the coordinates of the real CTA stations, and plots a slider so the user can see how stations are more or less busy (relative to each other) over the course of the day.
